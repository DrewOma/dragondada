**The LCIMU System Project**

The Low Cost Inertial Motion Unit (LCIMU) System project was carried out to build a motion capture
system that comprises of both a hardware and a software application component.
The purpose of the system was to serve as an affordable alternative to the commercially expensive inertial motion capture
system available today. This repository contains documentation for building the system (hardware and software) from the ground up.
The LCIMU software application is configured to implement the capture of inertial motion data from the LCIMU hardware system.
The LCIMU hardware system samples and captures inertial data at a frequency of 63Hz(Â±1). The data captured by the hardware system 
includes Time, Linear acceleration, Angular acceleration, Quaternion variables, Pitch,Yaw, Roll, Phi, Theta and Psi angles. 
The software application is configured to display some of the data in real time.
