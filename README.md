The LCIMU application is configured to implement the capture of inertial motion data from the LCIMU system.

It captures Time, Linear and Angular Acceleration, Quaternion variables and Pitch,Yaw, Roll, Phi, Theta,Psi angles

and will display some of the data in real time.

The Z_gitDataCaptured Folder contains data that has been captured during multiple actvities and stored in a csv file

The Z_Design Documentation Folder contains the design documentation for this project in pdf format.

The Z_Project Proposal Folder contains the proposal for this project in a pdf format.

The Z_User_Manual contains the User manual for the project in pdf format.

The Z_System_Test_Documentation contains a pdf file of the test plan as well as the test results of the project
It also contains the Test Result xml file (which contains the JUnit Test for all the classes tested).

The Z_Arduino_Source_Code folder contains the arduino source code of the LCIMU system in .txt format.

The Z_Matlab_Source_Code folder contains the matlab source code in matlab code format.

The Z_Management_Documentation folder contains the management documentation of the LCIMU project in a pdf format.

The Z_Video_Presentation folder contains the visual presentation of the LCIMU project as well as the tutorials.
 
The Structure of the Project is :
