The LCIMU application is configured to implement the capture of inertial motion data from the LCIMU system.

It captures Time, Linear and Angular Acceleration, Quaternion variables and Pitch,Yaw, Roll, Phi, Theta,Psi angles

and will display some of the data in real time.

The DataCaptured Folder contains data that has been captured during multiple actvities and stored in a csv file

The Z_Design Documentation Folder contains the design documentation for this project.

The Z_Project Proposal Folder contains the proposal for this project

The Z_User_Manual contains the User manual for the project

The Test Result xml file contains the JUnit Test for all the classes utilzed.

The Structure of the Project is :

*.idea *
